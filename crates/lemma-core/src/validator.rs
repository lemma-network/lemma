//! Validator identity, stake accounting, and consensus key types.
//!
//! # Dependency note
//!
//! `lemma-core` cannot depend on `lemma-crypto` (circular — `lemma-crypto`
//! already depends on `lemma-core`). [`ConsensusKey`] therefore mirrors the
//! raw-bytes representation of `lemma_crypto::PublicKey` without importing it.
//! This is the same pattern used by [`Signature`](crate::Signature): raw bytes
//! in `lemma-core`, crypto operations in `lemma-crypto` which adds
//! `From<lemma_crypto::PublicKey> for ConsensusKey` on its side.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! All collections that affect staking / voting power use `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`
//! or sorted `Vec` — never `HashMap`/`HashSet` (AGENTS.md §7.1).
//! All arithmetic uses `Amount::checked_*` (AGENTS.md §7.4).
//!
//! See `docs/13-VALIDATOR_EPOCH_SPEC.md` §1 and §2.
